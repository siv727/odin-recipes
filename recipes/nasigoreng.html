    <p>Nasi Goreng is the popular Indonesian fried rice which is traditionally served with a fried egg. I love the
        unique dark brown, caramelised colour of the rice! It’s a simple recipe, you won’t need to hunt down any unusual
        ingredients, and it’s one of my favourite Indonesian foods – and I’m betting you will love it too.</p>
    <p>Anyone who has been to Bali would be familiar with Nasi Goreng and probably had it almost every day because it’s
        everywhere and darn delicious! So for those who have tried and love Nasi Goreng, you will be surprised how easy
        this is to make in your very
        own home. And for those who haven’t tried it, I hope you do!</p>
    <p>The literal translation of Nasi Goreng is “fried rice” in Indonesian and Malaysian – and that’s exactly what it
        is! It’s mainly rice with just a little bit of meat and just onion for the vegetables. The thing that
        distinguishes it from other Fried Rice dishes is the sauce which is made with kecap manis, a sweet soy sauce
        that stains the rice dark brown and caramelises the rice when it cooks.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 leek, chopped</li>
        <li>2 green chile peppers, chopped</li>
        <Li>1 clove garlic, minced</Li>
        <li>1/2 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1/2 pound peeled and deveined shrimp</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>3 cups cold cooked white rice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons kecap manis (sweet soy sauce)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Coat with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Pour eggs into the hot skillet and cook until the edges begin to set. Lift the edges to allow any uncooked
            egg to flow onto the hot pan, about 1 minute. Flip omelet in one piece and cook until fully set, about 30
            seconds. Transfer omelet to a cutting board and slice into 1/2-inch strips. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large frying pan over high heat. Stir in onion, leek, chile peppers, and
            garlic. Cook and stir until onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in chicken, shrimp, coriander, and cumin;
            mix well. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix in cooked rice, sweet soy sauce, and omelet strips; cook until rice is heated through and chicken is no
            longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
