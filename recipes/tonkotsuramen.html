    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Made with an intensely porky, opaque pale broth with a sticky-lipped intensity and the rich, buttery texture of
        light cream,
        there's no smell more warming on a cold day than a big hot bowl of tonkotsu ramen set before you. The best
        sports tiny nubbins
        of fat swimming around on their surface, a slick of mayu (black garlic oil) or chile-sesame paste, a handful of
        thin-sliced
        green onions, a soft-yolked soy-sauce tinged egg, and a few slices of meltingly tender chashu pork belly.
        It's the ultimate meal-in-a-bowl and what any Japanese businessperson—and a good deal of Americans these
        days—thinks of
        the moment you mention comfort food.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <h3>Tonkotsu Ramen Broth</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the pork bones into a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook
            at a rolling boil for 5 minutes. Drain the pork bones into a colander in the sink and rinse well until water
            against the bones runs clear; this is the most important step of the process.</li>
        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Saute function. Warm the olive
            oil in the pot. Add leeks, onion, and garlic. Saute until onion is clear and has begun to brown, 7 to 10
            minutes. Turn Saute mode off.</li>
        <li>Place the cleaned pork bones into the inner pot on top of the onion mixture. Add 4 cups of water. Place the
            lid onto the Instant Pot, with the vent set to Sealing. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's
            instructions; set timer for 45 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40
            minutes, or turn vent to Venting.</li>
        <li>Remove lid and carefully remove the inner pot. Strain the stock in a cheesecloth-lined colander that is
            placed on top of a large saucepan. Set aside. Remove any remaining meat from bones and set aside.</li>
        <li>Season strained broth with salt and pepper. Add in dashi and remaining 1 cup water. Stir in soy sauce. Bring
            broth to a slow boil over medium-low heat; turn heat down to a simmer. Scoop out 1/3 cup of the broth into a
            bowl. Add the miso into the bowl and "soften" the miso with a spoon, dissolving it into the broth. Return
            this paste to the saucepan. Mix paste into the broth and combine well. Add spinach to the broth. Continue
            simmering for 10 minutes (do not bring to a boil).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring water to a boil in a pot. Add ramen noodles and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Drain and
            rinse and place a good handful into a serving bowl. Pour tonkotsu broth into the bowl using a ladle. Add the
            pulled meat from the bones atop the noodles; add the spinach.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Chashu pork belly</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the soy, sake, mirin, sugar, garlic and green onions in a ziploc bag large enough to hold the pork
            belly. Stick a straw in the bag and seal the ziploc bag up against it (so the straw is the only opening).
            Suck as much of the air out as you can and seal.</li>
        <li>Sous vide the pork for 10-11 hours at 170F.</li>
        <li>Remove pork from the ziploc bag. Discard the bag and marinade.</li>
        <li>Let the chashu pork belly cool completely.</li>
        <li>Slice across the chashu pork (so you get bacon like slices) – into 8-12 slices about 1/8 to 3/16 inches
            thick. Reserve. You won’t need all the pork for 4 servings.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Soy bacon tare</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all the ingredients in a small sauce pan. Simmer at the lowest setting for about an hour. Top up
            with a bit of chicken stock if needed.</li>
        <li>Remove the bacon.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Miso tare</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients in a small sauce pan and simmer at the lowest setting for about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Medium boiled eggs</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring enough water to cover the eggs to a boil. If you have a way to prick the eggshell do it. Boil large
            eggs for 6 minutes 30 seconds. If using extra large eggs boil them for 7 minutes 30 seconds. You may have to
            adjust your times slightly depending on the exact size of your eggs but this should get you pretty close.
        </li>
        <li>Submerge the eggs in cold or ice water to chill. This stops the egg yolks from continuing to set up. Peel.
            Cut in half right before you serve your tonkotsu ramen.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble the tonkotsu ramen</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the ramen noodles in plenty of water as directed by the packaging. If there’s no translation on the
            packaging usually its 4 minutes. You don’t need to salt the water.</li>
        <li>Cook the mushrooms along side the noodles – you just want them softened.</li>
        <li>Gently fry the chashu pork in a non-stick skillet until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Place 1/4 of whichever tare you are using in the bottom of four bowls.</li>
        <li>Ladle in about 1/2 cup of the tonkotsu broth into each of the bowls and stir to mix.</li>
        <li>Add the noodles. Pour in another 1 1/2 cups of the tonkotsu broth per bowl.</li>
        <li>Top with the egg, mushrooms, pork and green onions.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>I’ve provided 2 different tare recipes. Use one or the other or come up with your own.</p>
    <p>If you use the miso tare, you can salt your broth directly. That is easier than guessing how salty you want your
        tare.</p>
    <p>If you aren’t up for making chashu pork you can substitute roasted pork shoulder. It would be an awesome use of
        leftover pork roast…</p>
